  protected configuration commands and scoped delegated formatting (#130).

- Make semantic application-selection helpers consistently accept the
  human-readable application identifier order in every binding.

  validate key-set storage widths at the FFI boundary, and enforce Rust 1.85
  compatibility in CI.

  full byte-sized input domain across authenticated session families (#116).
- Validate binding integers before narrowing them to native field widths (#117).
- Stop Rust reader exchanges on terminal native statuses, preserve card status
  in Python and Rust, retry capacity failures, and verify both bindings' reader
  status constants against the C header (#136, #143).

  any failure, and enforce decoder coverage with a registry check and fuzz
  invariant (#115).
- Document and verify the 2.0 source-release process and artifacts.
- Generate target and Rust static libraries with the toolchain's native code
  model, and reserve position-independent objects for shared and JNI libraries.

  frames, model structures, and configured storage capacities.
- Refactor credential validation and serialization around explicit model invariants.
- Reject invalid communication settings, key references, transaction-MAC key
  types, and reserved access-right fields across credential codecs (#135).

  retaining plaintext operation for free change access (#122).

  report EV1 short reads with the EOF warning (#120).
- Accept zero-initialized credentials with empty file and key pools.
- Make credential and file-pool updates transactional.
- Reuse prepared cipher contexts and stream segmented AES, DES, and TDEA MAC input,
  removing message-sized secure-messaging scratch buffers.
- Enforce explicit output capacities and initialization contracts across secure
  messaging operations (#124).
- Propagate cipher and MAC failures, reject overflowing or malformed inputs,
  and consistently wipe staged output, retired ISO-DEP requests, file-pool
  bytes, replay buffers, and secret scratch storage.
- Make reader, native, ISO, ISO-DEP, EV1, and EV2 retries state-atomic across
  authentication, response-capacity, chaining, and transport failures.
- Preserve the transaction identifier and establish a fresh command counter
  when EV2 NonFirst authentication changes the active key (#118).
- Distinguish valid zero-length D40 reads from authentication failure, reject
  MAC-only responses when a read requested data, and reject missing,
  truncated, or incorrect response MACs (#119).
- Report required JNI response lengths, wipe invalidated ISO-DEP responses,
  reset expired activations, and support ISO-DEP record commands.
- Roll back failed SDM, delegated-application, transaction-MAC, CommitReaderID,
  value, file-creation, and key-update operations.
- Preserve transactions across current-key changes while aborting them on
  application changes and terminal command failures.

  update publication.
- Enforce file access rights and supported communication modes for ISO binary
  and record operations, including authenticated read CMACs (#120).
- Protect EV1 responses centrally, retain command-specific plain success
  responses, keep GetVersion continuation frames plain until the authenticated
  terminal response, and keep failures that retire authentication plain (#121).
- Apply the effective communication mode after access-right evaluation.
- Validate SDM counter keys, metadata-mirroring applicability, reset layouts,
  and reserved access-rights values, and reset the SDM read counter when its
  configuration changes.

  separate from active authorization state.
- Reduce each secure-messaging and reader-session object by 2,256 bytes by
  eliminating message-sized scratch storage.

  closed-object access, callback reentry, disposal, finalization, and concurrent
  calls.

  JNI secret-wipe verification.
- Wipe reader command storage at terminal exits and consume copied FFI response
  buffers promptly (#123).
- Standardize replay-random exhaustion across the hosted bindings.
- Make random providers fallible in ABI 5 and fail random-dependent operations
  atomically, distinguish retryable exhaustion from terminal backend failures,
  and propagate both consistently through every binding (#131).
- Propagate every native virtual-PICC status through the .NET binding (#139).
- Verify SDM random-padding failures leave counters, cached renders, and card
  sessions unchanged across native and ISO reads (#134).
- Enforce GetFileCounters file, access-key, command-MAC, and Full-response
  rules across D40, EV1, and EV2 sessions (#132).
- Make credential factory and blank initialization, and virtual-card
  anticollision, report random-source failures through boolean return values.
- Abort rejected ISO authentication handshakes and require a fresh challenge.
